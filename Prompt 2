⚠️ Current Issues (Based on Review)
Hardcoded Data
Most of the client values (weight, macros, compliance, etc.) are constants in useState rather than being dynamically loaded or editable.
🔧 Fix: Create editable fields and persist them.

No Data Entry Flow
There’s no way to:

Enter new daily check-ins

Modify or confirm completed training/cardio

Adjust macros based on phase/progress
🔧 Fix: Build editable weekly/day input panels with backend or local persistence.

Weekly Planner Is Static
The weekly planner just displays hardcoded entries.
🔧 Fix: Allow input via dropdowns, checkbox toggles, or mini-forms per day.

No Timeline/Date Context
Excel had per-date rows (weekly/daily tracking). The app lacks actual calendar linkage.
🔧 Fix: Implement date-tracked weekly views with ability to archive/view past weeks.

Compliance Not Editable
The compliance percentages are fixed; user cannot input or track their actual adherence rates.
🔧 Fix: Add input logic and summary auto-calculation from submetrics (e.g., training + cardio).

No Client-Editable Goals or Metrics
Goal weight, target steps, macros, mood logs, etc., are fixed in code.
🔧 Fix: Add client/coach-editable parameters with save functionality.

Data Does Not Persist
No backend or localStorage support for saving check-in forms, progress, or goals.
🔧 Fix: Use localStorage or Firebase (or Supabase) for data persistence and historical views.

Missing Breakdown Tabs from Excel
Excel included sections like:

PED log / supplement log

Weekly averages

Psychological feedback fields

Daily and weekly energy levels, hunger, sleep
🔧 Fix: Integrate tabs or accordion panels with rating selectors.

✅ What to Build — Step-by-Step
🗂️ 1. Refactor All Static Data into Editable Inputs
Convert all client constants (weight, start date, goal weight, compliance rates) to controlled state via forms.

Each section should be editable inline or via modal.

Add “Save” and “Reset” buttons to persist or revert.

📅 2. Weekly View Builder
Replace hardcoded weekly planner with:

A form to dynamically build each week's structure.

Inputs per day: training, macros, cardio target, cardio actual, steps, mood, sleep.

Enable duplication from previous week or template use.

📝 3. Dynamic Check-In Entries
Build a check-in form that allows:

Tracking training/cardio compliance

Mood, hunger, digestion, libido, etc.

Weight/waist/hip/chest updates

Store these entries and reflect them in weekly/daily summaries.

📊 4. Visual Trends
Use Recharts or Victory to show progress over time:

Weight trends

Sleep duration

Cardio minutes/week

Mood/hunger ratings

🧠 5. Coach/Admin Panel
Allow coach to configure:

Target macros (training/rest days)

Daily step/cardio goals

Check-in deadlines

Store preset protocols that can be applied to new weeks.

🔄 6. Integrate Supplement & PED Library
Extract from Excel and integrate with dropdowns:

Supplement dose, timing, start date

Cycle logs with duration, status

Option to mark as "on-cycle," “off,” “tapering,” etc.

📆 7. Week Navigation System
Weekly dashboard view with “Previous Week” / “Next Week” buttons

Auto-snapshot on week end (save and lock data)

Past weeks should be viewable but not editable (unless admin)

💾 8. Data Persistence Strategy
Options:

LocalStorage (for now) with JSON.stringify state

Firebase (preferred)

Structure by user → week number/date → metrics

Make backend modular to allow future export to CSV or spreadsheet

🏗️ System Architecture Requests
Please provide:

Suggested modular folder structure for this enhancement

Components that should be extracted/refactored (i.e., WeeklyEditor, DailyCard, CheckInForm)

State management method: useContext or Zustand/redux

Persistent layer recommendation: localStorage, IndexedDB, Supabase, or Firebase


🔍 Sheet-to-App Mapping Breakdown (What Your Excel Does)
From the Excel file (Meshal Alawein.xlsx), these were the functional flows:

📅 Weekly Planning (Sheet Logic)

Day	Training	Cardio	Steps	Macros/Meals	Sleep	Mood	Notes
Monday	Push Day A	40 min	10k	2300 kcal	7 hrs	😐	-
Tuesday	Cardio + Abs	60 min	12k	2200 kcal	6 hrs	😴	Low energy
...	...	...	...	...	...	...	...
→ Data was entered daily, then summarized weekly: compliance %, check-in scores, progress.

🧠 Mind & Recovery Log
Mood (1–10)

Libido

Digestion

Soreness

Sleep Quality

Logged daily in Excel; visualized weekly with flags for red zones.

📦 PED / Supplement Tracking

Compound	Dose	Time	Duration	Notes
Test E	150mg	Mon/Thu	16 wks	Cruise
Clenbuterol	40mcg	AM	2 wks on	Cycle 1
🧮 Weekly Calculations (in Excel)
% Compliance = Days hit / Total Days

TDEE = Weight × Multiplier (adjusted weekly)

Protein Target = Bodyweight × selected range

Auto-calculated progress (delta weight, delta waist)

❌ Issues in Current App

Module	Issue
WeeklyCompliance.tsx	Hardcoded complianceData (not calculated, not editable)
ClientOverview.tsx	Displays static data (e.g., fixed weight/goal)
NutritionOverview.tsx	No actual food/macros tracking, just displays fixed info
No PED/supplement logs	Not interactive, not phase-aware
No check-in logging	Missing dynamic daily log or weekly survey
No calendar logic	Cannot see week-to-week data or past logs

💡 Updated Prompt for Bolt AI (Expanded + Flow-Aware)
🧠 Save this to your doc: it updates your Coaching Dashboard Prompt to include flow validation and architecture clarity.

🧾 “New Bolt Prompt” with Flow Awareness
Hi Bolt.ai,

The dashboard we previously developed is a great start, but it lacks interactive data flow. I’ve included a workbook I originally built in Excel (Meshal Alawein.xlsx) which demonstrates how the data is tracked weekly/daily. Here's the upgraded prompt based on that logic.

🔁 Core Problems to Fix
All dashboard data is hardcoded (useState in WeeklyCompliance.tsx, ClientOverview.tsx, etc.)

There’s no form-based data entry for:

Daily tracking (mood, weight, sleep)

Weekly metrics (compliance, check-ins)

Supplement/PED schedules

No persistent weekly state (each week resets)

No week navigation or historical comparison

No feedback/journaling logic (like in Excel)

✅ What I Need (Feature-by-Feature)
📅 Weekly/Daily Tracker
Interactive weekly planner form:

For each day, input: training done, cardio minutes, macros hit, mood, digestion, sleep

Should use cards/tabs per day

Weekly summary auto-calculates:

Compliance % (days where targets were met)

Weight change

Avg sleep, avg mood

📥 Dynamic Check-in
End-of-week form with:

Self-assessment: stress, hunger, digestion, soreness, libido

Text feedback: wins, struggles, questions

Attached visual progress (weight graph, waist measurements)

💉 PED & Supplement Protocols
Editable tables for:

Compound name, dose, timing, frequency

Add/remove rows dynamically

Tag with phase (blast/cruise/cycle)

Weekly toggle: “Currently On” vs “Resting”

📈 Visualization
Recharts/Victory line graphs:

Weight trend

Mood trend

Compliance over time

Graph toggles for weekly vs monthly vs custom

🗃 Data Architecture
Store check-ins per week object:

ts
Copy
Edit
interface WeekData {
  dateRange: string;
  checkIns: DailyCheckIn[];
  weeklySummary: WeeklyStats;
  supplements: SupplementEntry[];
  PEDs: PEDCycleEntry[];
}
🧠 Persistence & Scaling
Store WeekData[] locally or in Firebase

Ability to export entire log as CSV

Add authentication to protect sensitive data
