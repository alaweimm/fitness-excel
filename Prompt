I've built a comprehensive coaching dashboard using React. Now, I want to expand it with advanced libraries of selectable data and programming templates across 5 key areas. These libraries should be modular, searchable, scalable, and allow for coach-driven customization.

🧠 System Objective
Enhance the dashboard with the following smart libraries and tools:

1. Nutrition Tracking with Macro Calculations

Calories per serving

Glycemic index

Tags (vegan, keto, halal, etc.)

USDA/FDC/Nutritionix integration (optional)

🍱 Meal Templates
Cutting, bulking, maintenance

Carb cycling, keto, paleo, Mediterranean, IF

Time-restricted eating protocols

🔧 Calculators
BMR + TDEE (Mifflin/St. Jeor & Katch-McArdle options)

Macro split calculators:

Protein: 1.6–3.0 g/kg

Fat: 0.5–1.5 g/kg

❤️ Vitals
BP (auto-categorized: normal, stage 1, 2, hypertensive)

RHR, HRV, O2 Sat

Sleep metrics: total, REM/deep %, latency

Respiratory rate

Skin/body temp (useful for readiness/sickness)

🩺 Assessment Tools
VO2 max, resting HR

HRV trend analysis

Body comp (DEXA, skinfold, BIA)

Strength tests (1RM est, isometric holds)

Mobility/FMS screen

Symptom journals: joint pain, mood, digestion, libido, cognition, anxiety

4. PED Protocol Management
💉 Compound Library
Anabolics: Test (E/P/C), NPP/Deca, EQ, Dbol, Anadrol, Winstrol, Anavar, Tren, etc.

Peptides: HGH 191aa, IGF-1 LR3, BPC-157, TB500, GHRPs, GHRHs

SARMs: Ostarine, LGD-4033, RAD-140, S23, YK11

Thyroid: T3 (liothyronine), T4 (levothyroxine)

Insulin: Humalog, Lantus

Fat Burners: Clenbuterol, Albuterol, Ephedrine, DNP

AI/SERM: Anastrozole, Exemestane, Letrozole, Nolva, Clomid

Others: Cardarine, SR9009, EPO, GW1516

📦 Protocol Templates
TRT / HRT templates

Cutting: 8–20 week plans

Bulking: classic, lean, or “blast-cruise”

Contest prep

Performance enhancement: sprint, strength, endurance

Female-specific protocols (low-dose primos, anavar, etc.)

🧪 Support + PCT
Organ protection: TUDCA, NAC, hawthorn, baby aspirin

PCT templates: Clomid, Nolva, HCG regimens

Blood pressure stacks, lipid control

Estrogen rebound mitigation

🧮 Calculators
Weight-based dosing (mg/kg)

Injection frequency generator

Compound half-life chart + visualization

5. Supplement Tracking
💊 Supplement Library

⚙️ Desired Implementation
For each library, please assist with:

📦 Schema Design

JSON/DB structure to support filtering, versioning, user customization

🎨 Frontend UI

Component blueprints: searchable dropdowns, tag filtering, category tabs, card/grid views

➕ Custom Entry Support

Allow coaches to add their own foods, PEDs, exercises, etc.

🔍 Smart Filtering

Multi-tag filtering, search-as-you-type, sorting by categories or efficacy

🔁 Dashboard Integration

Realtime syncing to graphs, logs, protocols, or alerts (e.g., warning if client blood pressure is high while on tren + clen)

📎 GitHub
Project source: https://github.com/alaweimm/coaching-app-claude.git

✅ Constraints
Must scale for 1000+ entries per library

Keep UI lightweight and mobile responsive

Protect sensitive health/PED data (auth layer if needed)

Allow JSON import/export for each library for version control
